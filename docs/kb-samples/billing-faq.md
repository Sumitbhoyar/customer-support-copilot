# Common questions
**Q: How are seats billed?**  
Seats are prorated daily and billed monthly.

Admins can change plans in Admin > Billing. Changes take effect immediately; credits or overages are applied on the next invoice.

**Q: What payment methods are supported?**  
Credit card (Visa, MasterCard, AmEx) and bank transfer for annual invoices.

**Q: How do I get invoices/receipts?**  
Invoices are emailed to the billing contact and available in Admin > Billing > Invoices.

**Q: Can I add a tax/VAT ID?**  
Yes, add it under Admin > Billing > Tax details.

# Troubleshooting charges
- Unexpected charge: check if new seats were added mid-cycle.
- Card declined: verify address/ZIP and retry; if it persists, contact support with the decline code.
- Duplicate charge: rare; open a ticket with both transaction IDs for review.
